# Prisma-Social-Media

This is my old portfolio project. It's messy but it all works properly as far as I know. It has group video chat, file sharing, video sharing, live posts, votes, embedded comments, et cet. It uses prisma, express, react & tailwindcss. I am making a new "social media" website with go, called go-social-media, which is also on my github account but not finished yet.
